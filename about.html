    <div class="headings">
    <h2>Traffic Management System</h2>
    <p>A dynamic real-time traffic management system, developed using Python and OpenCV, actively monitors traffic congestion in proximity to signalized intersections. The system employs computer vision to detect and accurately count the number of vehicles traversing a specific junction. This comprehensive vehicle count enables the precise assessment of traffic magnitude at the targeted location. With this information readily available, the system can intelligently redirect a portion of the traffic to alternative routes, contributing to more effective traffic flow management and improved overall transportation efficiency 
        In addition to its traffic monitoring capabilities, this system boasts an integrated multilingual chatbot. This chatbot enhances user interaction and accessibility by supporting multiple languages, allowing users to receive real-time updates on traffic conditions, inquire about alternative routes, and access relevant information in a language of their choice. This multilingual feature not only enriches user experience but also ensures effective communication with a diverse range of road users.</p>
